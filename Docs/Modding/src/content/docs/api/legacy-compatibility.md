Early `sf2.shop.add` and `sf2.mod.log/warn/error` calls remain aliases for
`sf2.shop.addItem` and `sf2.log.info/warn/error`. New mods should use the new names.
Legacy `sprites/*.png` assets and optional sibling `*.sprite.toml` descriptors
still load. To migrate, move the PNG to `textures/` and replace its optional
sidecar with a `.asset` descriptor containing `type` and `texture`; the sprite's
logical ID can stay unchanged. Do not leave both the PNG and `.asset` at that
same logical ID.

Core TAR bundles retain their existing `.meta` descriptors and legacy addresses.
This loose-mod format does not modify Unity `.meta` files or core asset identity.
